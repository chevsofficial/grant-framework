## Project Overview

### Overview

- **Name:** The EOS Chatbot - User Onboarding & Semi-Automated Support
- **Brief Description:** Traditional digital marketing funnels look something like this, Lead Magnet > Landing Page > Follow-Up > Sales. The premise is as follows, have a juicy incentive (lead magnet) that attracts leads to a website (landing page) in which the objective is to convert to sale or to collect user data like email and phone to provide valuable follow up via email or SMS marketing to convert leads into customers (users). Our objective is to build a user onboarding funnel with utilizing a conversational interface (The EOS Chatbot) which is proven to have higher conversion rates than traditional funnels.
- **Relationship to EOSIO:** The EOS Chatbot is built specifically for the EOS blockchain which is built using the EOSIO software
- **Reason for Interest:** I'm a genesis EOS user, I love EOS and want to build cool stuff that provides value to the EOS community and it's ecosystem.

## Development Roadmap

This section should break the development roadmap down into milestones and deliverables. To assist you in defining it, we have created a document with examples for some grant categories [here](../docs/grant_guidelines_per_category.md). Since these will be part of the agreement, it helps to describe _the functionality we should expect in as much detail as possible_, plus how we can verify and test that functionality. Whenever milestones are delivered, we refer to this document to ensure that everything has been delivered as expected.

Below we provide an **example roadmap**. In the descriptions, it should be clear how your project is related to the EOS ecosystem. We _recommend_ that teams structure their roadmap as 1 milestone â‰ˆ 1 month.

For each milestone,

- make sure to include a specification of your software. _Treat it as a contract_; the level of detail must be enough to later verify that the software meets the specification.
- include the amount of funding requested _per milestone_.
- include documentation (tutorials, API specifications, architecture diagrams, whatever is appropriate) in each milestone. This ensures that the code can be widely used by the community.
- provide a test suite, comprising unit and integration tests, along with a guide on how to set up and run them.
- commit to providing Dockerfiles for the delivery of your project.
- indicate milestone duration as well as number of full-time employees working on each milestone.
- **Deliverables 0a-0c are mandatory for all milestones**, and deliverable 0e at least for the last one. If you do not intend to deliver one of these, please state a reason in its specification (e.g. Milestone X is research oriented and as such there is no code to test).

### Milestone Summary

- **Total Costs:** 4,000 USD
