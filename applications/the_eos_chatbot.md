## Project Overview

### Overview

- **Name:** The EOS Chatbot - User Onboarding & Semi-Automated Support
- **Brief Description:** Traditional digital marketing funnels look something like this, Lead Magnet > Landing Page > Follow-Up > Sales. The premise is as follows, have a juicy incentive (lead magnet) that attracts leads to a website (landing page) in which the objective is to convert to sale or to collect user data like email and phone to provide valuable follow up via email or SMS marketing to convert leads into customers (users). Our objective is to build a user onboarding funnel with utilizing a conversational interface (The EOS Chatbot) which is proven to have higher conversion rates than traditional funnels.
- **Relationship to EOSIO:** The EOS Chatbot is built specifically for the EOS blockchain which is built using the EOSIO software
- **Reason for Interest:** I'm a genesis EOS user, I love EOS and want to build cool stuff that provides value to the EOS community and it's ecosystem.

### Project Details

### Ecosystem Fit

- Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem?
The EOS Chatbot fits as the #1 virtual assistant for the EOS Network. Helping with different areas, responding to frequently asked questions, helping with project discovery, giving users access to resources and tools, boosting the efficiency of different marketing campaigns.
- Who is your target audience (chain/dapp/wallet/UI developers, designers, your own user base, some dapp's userbase, yourself)?
Our target audience are the users from the EOS network, primarily focusing on the average new user on EOS.
- What need(s) does your project meet?
Quick and efficient automated support and accessibility to community resources, project discovery and earning opportunities.
- Are there any other projects similar to yours in the EOSIO ecosystem?
The EOS Chatbot is currently the only conversational marketing interface within the EOSIO ecosystem.
  - If so, how is your project different?
 
  - If not, are there similar projects in related ecosystems?
Similar projects are the CreateEOSAccount_Bot - [Telegram](https://t.me/CreateEOSAccount_Bot) [Pomelo](https://pomelo.io/grants/eosaccountcr) and the Bot for Eden - [Pomelo](https://pomelo.io/grants/bot4eden)

## Development Roadmap

This section should break the development roadmap down into milestones and deliverables. To assist you in defining it, we have created a document with examples for some grant categories [here](../docs/grant_guidelines_per_category.md). Since these will be part of the agreement, it helps to describe _the functionality we should expect in as much detail as possible_, plus how we can verify and test that functionality. Whenever milestones are delivered, we refer to this document to ensure that everything has been delivered as expected.

Below we provide an **example roadmap**. In the descriptions, it should be clear how your project is related to the EOS ecosystem. We _recommend_ that teams structure their roadmap as 1 milestone ≈ 1 month.

For each milestone,

- make sure to include a specification of your software. _Treat it as a contract_; the level of detail must be enough to later verify that the software meets the specification.
- include the amount of funding requested _per milestone_.
- include documentation (tutorials, API specifications, architecture diagrams, whatever is appropriate) in each milestone. This ensures that the code can be widely used by the community.
- provide a test suite, comprising unit and integration tests, along with a guide on how to set up and run them.
- commit to providing Dockerfiles for the delivery of your project.
- indicate milestone duration as well as number of full-time employees working on each milestone.
- **Deliverables 0a-0c are mandatory for all milestones**, and deliverable 0e at least for the last one. If you do not intend to deliver one of these, please state a reason in its specification (e.g. Milestone X is research oriented and as such there is no code to test).

> :zap: If any of your deliverables is based on someone else's work, make sure you work and publish _under the terms of the license_ of the respective project and that you **highlight this fact in your milestone documentation** and in the source code if applicable! **Teams that submit others' work without attributing it will be immediately terminated.**

### Milestone Summary

> Note: the numbers in the three lines below are examples.  Please replace with your own calculations!  Then delete this instruction line.
> You **must** keep these three Milestone Summary lines below for your grant to be approved.  The Total Cost should add up to the costs
> of all of your Milestones.
- **Total Estimated Duration:** 2 months 
- **Full-Time Equivalent (FTE):** 2 FTE
- **Total Costs:** 12,000 USD

> Please note that this application is automatically parsed.<br/>
> For the above fields, please only put the answer on that line.  If you want to add more information, please put it below these instructions.<br/>
> Please remember to delete all lines that start with `>` as they are just instructions and not needed in the application submission.<br/>
> 
> Notes on above fields:
> - Total Estimated Duration: Duration of the whole project (example: 2 months or 7 weeks)
> - Full-Time Equivalent (FTE): This is the average number of full-time employees working on the project throughout its duration (see [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full-time_equivalent), example: 2 FTE or possibly 2.5 FTE as it is an average)
> - Total Costs: This should be the requested amount in USD for the whole project (example 12,000 USD). Note that the acceptance criteria and additional benefits vary depending on the [level](../README.md#grant-levels) of funding requested. This and the costs for each milestone need to be provided in USD; if the grant is paid out in EOS, the amount will be calculated according to the exchange rate at the time of payment.
